# DAA Lab – Design and Analysis of Algorithms  
3rd Year | 5th Semester (B.Tech CSE)

This repository contains day-wise programs completed in the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Lab.  
Each folder is named according to the lab day (Day-01, Day-02, …) and includes the program files and sample input/output where needed.

## Topics Covered
- Time Complexity and Analysis
- Divide and Conquer (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Greedy Algorithms (Activity Selection, Kruskal, Prim)
- Dynamic Programming (0/1 Knapsack, Matrix Chain Multiplication)
- Backtracking (N-Queens, Subset Sum)
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Bellman-Ford)
- Branch and Bound Concepts

## Language Used
